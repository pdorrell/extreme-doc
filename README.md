Extreme-Doc
===========

This a project to explore the concept of *Extreme Documentation*
as explained at [Extreme Negative Code Documentation].

There are two principle tools to create:

   - An extension of Pygments to allow the "extreme" comments to not be viewed, by default
   - A merge tool to allow a version of code containing "extreme" comments to be maintained separately from the primary version of source code without the extreme comments.
