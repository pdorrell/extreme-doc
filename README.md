Extreme-Doc
===========

This a project to explore the concept of *Extreme Documentation*
as explained at [Extreme Negative Code Documentation].

Work in progress:

   - Merge tools to allow a version of code containing "extreme" comments to be maintained separately from the primary version of source code without the extreme comments.
